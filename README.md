# React Context 

## Overview

This repository contains two React projects that demonstrate the use of the Context API:

1. **Mini Context**: An introductory project that showcases the basic usage of the Context API.
2. **Major Context**: A more advanced project that implements a theme switcher, allowing users to toggle between light and dark modes using the Context API.

## Projects

### Mini Context

**Description**: This project serves as an introduction to the React Context API. It demonstrates how to create a context, provide it to components, and consume it within those components.

**Key Features**:
- Creation of a context object.
- Provider component to wrap child components.
- Consumer components that access context values.

### Major Context

**Description**: This project builds on the concepts learned in Mini Context by implementing a theme switcher. Users can toggle between light and dark themes, with the current theme stored in context.

**Key Features**:
- Theme management using the Context API.
- Responsive UI that changes styles based on the selected theme.
- Demonstration of how to update context values dynamically.
